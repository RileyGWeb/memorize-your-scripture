# How to Install the Scripture App (Beta) on Your iPhone

Hi! Thanks for helping test my app. Here's how to get it on your phone:

## Step 1: Get TestFlight (Apple's Testing App)
1. Open the **App Store** on your iPhone
2. Search for **"TestFlight"** 
3. Download the free app from Apple (it has a blue icon with a plane)

## Step 2: Wait for My Email
You'll receive an email from **"App Store Connect"** with the subject line like "You're invited to test Memorize Your Scripture"

**Check your spam/junk folder** if you don't see it!

## Step 3: Install My App
1. Open the email invitation
2. Tap the blue **"View in TestFlight"** button
3. Your iPhone will open the TestFlight app
4. Tap **"Accept"**
5. Tap **"Install"**
6. Wait for it to download

## Step 4: You're Done!
The app will appear on your home screen with a small orange dot (showing it's a beta test version).

## Questions?

**"I didn't get an email"**
- Check your spam/junk folder
- Make sure I have your correct email address
- The email can take 1-2 days to arrive

**"The link says it's expired"**
- Let me know and I'll send a new invitation

**"TestFlight says 'Install' is greyed out"**
- Make sure you're signed into iCloud with the same email I sent the invitation to
- Go to Settings → [Your Name] to check

**"I can't find TestFlight in the App Store"**
- Search for exactly "TestFlight" - it's a free app by Apple
- It should be the first result with a blue icon
