## stuff to do
### Use TDD! When doing a new feature, write tests for how it should function first. Only once tests are passing, then implement the feature.
### Always create test coverage for new features!
### Always run all tests after every change is completed!
### Check off items as you complete them.
### Do not stop iterating until all tests are complete!
