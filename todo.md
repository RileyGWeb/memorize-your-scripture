## stuff to do
### Use TDD! When doing a new feature, write tests for how it should function first. Only once tests are passing, then implement the feature.
### Always create test coverage for new features!
### Always run all tests after every change is completed!
### Check off items as you complete them.
### Do not stop iterating until all tests are complete!

[x] There shouldnt be a way to dismiss / X the memorize later verse suggestions. Some filters and a search might be good though. Also instead of "Note - {date}" on the memorized cerse, let's do "added X days ago". Or hours ago, you get the idea.
